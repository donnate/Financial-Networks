# Financial-Networks


Just a fun applied project a few months ago for analysing financial time series! The code hasn't been cleaned up yet (Dec. 3rd), and is thus probably not very explicit (currently working on improving it)!

The goal would be to "filter" the correlation matrix between different time series, so as to get a "network" of meaningful correlations between entities. The approach investigated here tries to tackle the problem from a "hierarchical clustering" perspective.
